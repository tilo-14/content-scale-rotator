## Animation Project Summary

**Created**: A flip-clock style text animation for Solana scaling messaging

### Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Three.js-inspired 3D transforms
- **Typography**: Roboto font (italic, 496.29px for high-res capture)
- **Animation**: 3D cube rotation effect using CSS `rotateX` transforms with perspective depth
- **Background**: Pure black (#000000) for high contrast

### Animation Sequence
Rotating text display showing "Scale [X]" where X cycles through:
1. on Solana
2. Accounts
3. Tokens  
4. PDAs
5. Apps
6. ZK
7. Anything (final state)

### Timing Mechanics
- **0.5s** static display per word
- **0.5s** rotation transition (flip effect)
- **1.0s** total per word
- **7.0s** complete sequence

### Key Features
- Mechanical flip-clock aesthetic with 3D depth perception
- Simultaneous rotation (old word rotates down, new word rotates in from above)
- Horizontal center-axis rotation mimicking physical cube faces
- Optimized for GIF export via screen recording
- Responsive design with high-resolution capture support (496.29px font size)
